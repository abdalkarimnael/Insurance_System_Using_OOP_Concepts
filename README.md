# Insurance System Using OOP Concepts

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **Insurance Management System** developed using **Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**. It models an insurance system where employees, departments, and beneficiary family members are managed through different classes. **It's my first task by the manager as a full-stack developer intern**. 

## 📁 Project Structure
```plaintext
src/
│── BeneficiaryFamilyMembers.java  # Represents family members of an employee
│── Department.java                # Manages department details
│── Employee.java                   # Defines employee attributes and relationships
│── Insurance.java                   # Handles insurance details
│── Main2.java                       # Main entry point for the program
│── Person.java                       # Base class for employees and beneficiaries
```

## 🎯 Features
- **Encapsulation & Inheritance**: `Person` is the base class, while `Employee` and `BeneficiaryFamilyMembers` extend it.
- **Department Management**: Employees belong to departments.
- **Insurance Tracking**: Employees and their family members have insurance coverage.
- **Modular Design**: Each entity is separated into a dedicated class.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
